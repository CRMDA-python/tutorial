# Getting the Updated Git Repo

The first thing that you want to do every time you start working with the materials we are providing is to check for updates on the files. Here is how you can do that with Git. 

![caution](https://github.com/CRMDA-python/tutorial/blob/master/content/images/caution-h50.png) DO NOT MODIFY THE NOTEBOOK FILES; INSTEAD, SAVE A COPY OF THE NOTEBOOK AND DO ALL YOUR WORK IN THE COPY

If you are on OS X/Linux, open your terminal and navigate to the "tutorial" directory (that's the directory you cloned last week). If you are on Windows, go to the folder you downloaded last week and right click somewhere in the white space. Then select "Git Bash Here". Once you have a command prompt, type the following commands:

```git
git checkout .  
git pull
```

Once you do that, Git will output something like this:
