    "# Mini Project from Week 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Weeks 1-5 have provided you with the basics of python functions. Let's try to work on a single project that will require you to use things you have learned so far, and things you haven't.. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "I used Blast to match butterfly proteins to a moth genome. The Blast output contains the following information (one hit/match per row):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Butterfly Protein Name\n",
    "- Moth Sequence ID\n",
    "- e-value (how good the match is; the lower the value the better)\n",
    "- Length (of the alignment between the two sequences)\n",
    "- Percent Identity (percent amino acid-nucleotide matched in the alignment)\n",
    "- Start of Alignment in Butterfly Protein\n",
    "- End of Alignment in Butterfly Protein\n",
    "- Start of Alignment in Moth Sequence\n",
    "- End of Alignment in Moth Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "__You don't need to know exactly what these variables are for the purposes of this exercise.__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the output files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- mc2moth.full.txt (entire data set)\n",
    "- mc2moth.sample.txt (first 10 rows)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are __tab delimited__ files. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a python program that will filter the data based on the following criteria:\n",
    "- e-value < 10e-100 (AND)\n",
    "- length > 300\n",
    "The alignments (rows) that fit this description should be output to a file called mc2moth.filtered.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Week #6 Practice Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "I have written a script that will filter the data based on the above mentioned criteria. But the script is full of bugs. Your goal for today is to debug my code. You __CANNOT__ use _print()_ statements!\n",
    "\n",
    "Sanity check: the output file should have 98 lines. \n"
