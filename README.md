# CRMDA Python Workgroup Git Repository
Fall 2016

In this repo, you will find guides to help you go through the core Python topics. 

## Required software
In order to take full advantage of the resources, you will need the following software:
 - Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 - Anaconda (https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

### Dowload Git and workgroup materials 
Once you have downloaded and installed Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads), you have to clone this repo (i.e. download all the folders and files). To clone the repo, do the following:
 - OS X/ Linux: after you have created a directory to store the materials, Open Terminal (Applications/Utilities/Terminal) and navigate to the directory you created.
 - Windows: create a directory for the materials and open it. Once in the directory, right-click and select "Git Bash Here."

To clone this repo, type the following command and press Enter:

git clone https://github.com/CRMDA-python/tutorial.git

### Download Anaconda

Download and install Anaconda, a data science platform based on Python. Go to https://www.continuum.io/downloads, and choose your operating system. Make sure to download the Python 3.5 version. 
A few notes on the installation process:
 - By default, Anaconda will do a local installation - all the necessary files will be in a location where you have read & write rights. Unless you have a custom configuration system and know what you are doing, I strongly suggest you go with the default installation location. 
  - For OS X/Linux users: when asked if you wish the installer to prepend Anaconda's installation location to your PATH in .bashrc, go ahead and type yes. Unless you know what that means; then, you can make your own decision. 
  - For Windows users: Install with the default options.
